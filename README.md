# Microsoft Teams Clone

This is a webRTC based video calling website .

Users can create a new chat room and can start chating also they can start video meeting anytime in this 
chat room. After the video meeting ends users are redirected to chat room and can continue their chat .

Users can start instant video meeting .After the meeting they are redircted to the 
chat room and can continue the chat or they can leave the room.

This implementation also consists of a real time chat and file share functionality. 

I developed this project using Agile Scrum methodology.
